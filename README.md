# Assembly_Language_Projects
This repository contains assembly programming projects completed for my university coursework.

- **Jupiter Assembler** (`.s` files)
- **RARS – RISC-V Assembler and Runtime Simulator** (`.asm` files)

Each project folder contains:
- Problem description (`.pdf`)
- Assembly code (`.s` or `.asm`)
- Input files (if applicable)
- Output screenshots or result verification
- A dedicated `README.md` with explanations and usage

---

## Setup & Usage

### Jupiter Assembler (for `.s` files)

- Download: [Jupiter GitHub Repository](https://github.com/andrescv/jupiter)
- How to Run:
  1. Open the Jupiter application.
  2. Load the `.s` file from the project folder.
